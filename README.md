## Regular Languages and Finite Automata  

## Closure Properties of Regular Languages  
✔ **Union**: If L₁ and L₂ are regular, then L₁ ∪ L₂ is regular  
✔ **Intersection**: If L₁ and L₂ are regular, then L₁ ∩ L₂ is regular  
✔ **Complement**: If L is regular, then L̅ is regular  
✔ **Concatenation**: If L₁ and L₂ are regular, then L₁·L₂ is regular  
✔ **Kleene Star**: If L is regular, then L* is regular  

## Myhill–Nerode Theorem  
**Theorem**:  
A language L ⊆ Σ* is regular iff ≡ₗ has finite equivalence
